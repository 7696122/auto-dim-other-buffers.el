# auto-dim-other-buffers.el

Visually makes non-current buffers less prominent.

By default, "less prominent" means "has a black background". But you might want to change that by customizing `auto-dim-other-buffers-face`.

Install via [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/): `M-x package-install auto-dim-other-buffers`

Enable with the command `turn-on-auto-dim-other-buffers`
